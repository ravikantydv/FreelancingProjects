<h2>Data Dictionary</h2>
<p><br><strong>Year Type</strong> - Fiscal (July through June) or
Calendar (January through December) <br><strong>Year</strong> - An
accounting period of 12 months. The City and County of San Francisco
operates on a fiscal year that begins on July 1 and ends on June 30 the
following year. The Fiscal Year ending June 30, 2012 is represented as
FY2011-2012. <br><strong>Organization Group Code</strong> - Org Group is
a group of Departments. For example, the Public Protection Org Group
includes departments such as the Police,Fire, Adult Probation, District
Attorney, and Sheriff. <br> <strong>Organization Group</strong> - Org
Group is a group of Departments. For example, the Public Protection Org
Group includes departments such as the Police, Fire, Adult Probation,

Unions represent employees in collective bargaining agreements. A job
belongs to one union, although some jobs are unrepresented (usually
temporarily). <br><strong>Union</strong> - Unions represent employees in
collective bargaining agreements. A job belongs to one union, although
some jobs are unrepresented (usually temporarily). <br><strong>Job
Family Code</strong> Job Family combines similar Jobs into meaningful
groups. <br><strong>Job Family</strong> Job Family combines similar Jobs
into meaningful groups. <br><strong>Employee Identifier</strong> Each
distinct number in the “Employee Identifier” column represents one
employee. These identifying numbers are not meaningful but rather are
randomly assigned for the purpose of building this dataset. The column
does not appear on the Employee Compensation report hosted on
openbook.sfgov.org, but that report does show one row for each employee.
Employee ID has been included here to allow users to reconstruct the
original report. Note that each employee’s identifier will change each
time this dataset is updated, so comparisons by employee across multiple
versions of the dataset are not possible. <br><strong>Salaries</strong>
- Normal salaries paid to permanent or temporary City employees.
<br><strong>Overtime</strong> - Amounts paid to City employees working
in excess of 40 hours per week. <br><strong>Other Salaries</strong> -
Various irregular payments made to City employees including premium pay,
incentive pay, or other one-time payments. Total Salary Number The sum
of all salaries paid to City employees. <br><strong>Retirement</strong>
City contributions to employee retirement plans.
<br><strong>Health/Dental</strong> City-paid premiums to health and
dental insurance plans covering City employees. To protect
confidentiality as legally required, pro-rated citywide averages are
presented in lieu of employee-specific health and dental benefits.
<br><strong>Other Benefits</strong> Mandatory benefits paid on behalf of
employees, such as Social Security (FICA and Medicare) contributions,
unemployment insurance premiums, and minor discretionary benefits not
included in the above categories. <br><strong>Total Benefits</strong>
The sum of all benefits paid to City employees. <br><strong>Total
Compensation</strong> The sum of all salaries and benefits paid to City
employees.</p>

<h3>Model Persistence (Optional)</h3>
<p>Model persistence means saving your model to a disk. After you
finalize your model for prediction depending upon the performance, you
need to save the model to the disk. Let's say, you finalize 'lrmodel' to
be used for in production environment i.e. in your application. We use
the following code to save it.</p>
