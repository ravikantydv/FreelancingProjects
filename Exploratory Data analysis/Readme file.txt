# Assignment Exploratory Data Analysis README

## Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for Assignment 2, which involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and implementing Logistic Regression (LR) from scratch. The goal is to analyze a dataset and create predictive models related to influenza using various data science techniques.

## Instructions for Running the Code

### Exploratory Data Analysis
1. To perform exploratory data analysis, run the notebook `Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb` using your preferred Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions within the notebook to complete the analysis.
3. The results and visualizations will be displayed within the notebook.

### Logistic Regression with One Variable
1. To run Logistic Regression with one variable, execute the script `logistic_regression_one_variable.py`.
2. Follow the comments within the script for detailed guidance on each step of the LR implementation.
3. The script will output performance metrics, including a confusion matrix and potentially graphs, to evaluate the model.

### Logistic Regression with Multiple Variables
1. To run Logistic Regression with multiple variables, execute the script `logistic_regression_multiple_variables.py`.
2. This script utilizes a predefined set of input variables.
3. Follow the comments within the script for guidance on running the LR model.
4. The script will output performance metrics and potentially graphs for evaluation.

### Experimenting with Regularization and Cost Function
1. Regularization and Feature Scaling:
   - To evaluate regularization's impact, run `regularization_experiment.py`.
   - To assess feature scaling's impact, run `feature_scaling_experiment.py`.

2. Cost Function:
   - For changing the cost function, You can create and run `cost_function_experiment.py`.

Follow the comments within each script for step-by-step instructions and result interpretation.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the same flu dataset (flue.csv)

## Academic Integrity
